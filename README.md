About OOP and SOLID:

*   In developing the game's architecture I prioritized object-oriented principles to achieve modularity and maintainability. For managing persistent data I employed encapsulation by grouping save/load operations and the data structure itself. This approach allows for clear separation of concerns hiding the data access details and providing a controlled interface. Furthermore the use of generics in the object pooling system significantly enhanced code reusability. This design allows for pooling of various object types without code duplication effectively adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.
*   In summary while OOP principles like encapsulation and abstraction were applied there's a need for stronger adherence to SOLID principles. Specifically refactoring the event management and utility function systems with a focus on Single Responsibility Open/Closed and Dependency Inversion would result in a more robust and adaptable game architecture.
